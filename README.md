# ArviZ Dashboard
Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models with dashboards

## Project Overview
This project brings dashboards to ArviZ enabling users to compare different visualizations in the same view and interact with them. 

We currently provide one dashboard for model comparison, in terms of the ELPD_loo values, which you can find in the `examples/elpd_dashboard.ipynb`. In the near future, more dashboards will be added to this repo

## Installation

**this package is still under construction, but we do provide ways for you to explore the embedded template**

To explore the elpd dashboard under `examples/elpd_dashboard.ipynb`, in addition to the packages mentioned in` requirements.txt`, you need install `pymc` to run all the program

## Usage

Dashboard usually includes multiple visualizations with different purposes. If you have any problems with certain visualization, you can find more explanations for the ArviZ visualizations in [ArvZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/examples/index.html) and  [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html)
