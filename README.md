# ArviZ Dashboard
Exploratory analysis of Bayesian models with dashboards

## Project Overview
This project brings dashboards to ArviZ enabling users to compare different visualizations in the same view and interact with them. 

We currently provide one dashboard for model comparison, in terms of the ELPD_loo values, which you can find in the `examples/elpd_dashboard.ipynb`. In the near future, more dashboards will be added to this repo

## Installation
```
git clone the REPO
cd arviz_dashboard
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Dashboard usually includes multiple visualizations with different purposes. If you have any problems with certain visualization, you can find more explanations for the ArviZ visualizations in [ArvZ](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/examples/index.html) and  [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html)
