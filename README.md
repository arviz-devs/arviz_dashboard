# Declarative Dashboard for Arviz

## Project Overview
This project intends to incorporate all sorts of ArviZ graphs in the dashboard as a separate Python library or ArviZ module which enable users compare different visualizations in the same view and interact with different visualizations at the same time. 

We have succefully implemented the first dashboard on ELPD and model comparison,which you can find in the `examples/elpd_dashboard.ipynb`. In the ear future, more dashboards will be added to this repo.
